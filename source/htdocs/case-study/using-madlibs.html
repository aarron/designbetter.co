      <p class="">Now that you’ve seen the power of POV’s in action, you may be looking for an opportunity to use them with your own team. Once again, the d.school has created a great resource for this from their Bootcamp Bootleg, the <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/point-of-view-madlib.pdf" target="_blank">POV Madlib</a>.</p>
      <p class="">You can use insights you’ve collected from your own users during the Camera Study exercise in the Empathize phase of this series, or any other current design problem that you are working on.</p>
      <p class="">The POV Madlib structure is very simple:</p>
      <p class="">You can also get a little fancier, like Doug did with his POV for the MRI redesign (“We met... We were amazed to realize... etc). Remember to paint a detailed picture of the user, and to use actionable insights. </p>
      <p class="">[USER] needs to [USER’S NEED] because [SURPRISING INSIGHT] </p>
      <p class="">Now take 15 minutes and try to generate at least 5 POVs using the Madlib. Use the checklist from earlier in this article to see which of your POVs tick off the most requirements. </p>
      <p class="">And remember, you are going to iterate on this POV, just as you’ll iterate on your prototypes later in the process. Don’t get too attached to it.</p>
