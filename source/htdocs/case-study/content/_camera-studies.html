        <p>Here is a step by step guide to creating the study:</p>
        <p><strong>User Camera Study</strong></p>
        <ul class="margin-top-none">
          <li><strong>Recruit users:</strong>  Just like the Minimum Viable Ethnography, you can use a tool like <a href="http://ethn.io/" target="_blank">ethnio</a> to recruit 3-4 users in a demographic that interests you, and use Amazon gift cards as an incentive. Explain the purpose of the study, and make sure to <a href="#bookmark=id.rc47uzzhak6l">get permission to use the images</a> that they take.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask users to document their environment:</strong> Depending on the area(s) of interest, this could be their morning routine, the environment where they are currently using your product, pictures of what is most meaningful to them on their desks, etc. Make sure to frame the request more broadly than just your specific area of interest, as you can get great insights from the user's broader environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask the users to walk you through the images:</strong> Interview them about what they share. (reserve the gift cards until they have shared out with you.)</li>
          <li><strong>Document and synthesize:</strong> Take careful notes, and if you have multiple team members observing the process, have them highlight particularly unexpected or interesting items on a sticky note. You can then throw these up on a whiteboard and start to pick out patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bobby Hughes, principal at <a href="http://www.aardvarkdesignlabs.com/" target="_blank">Aardvark Design Labs</a>, says that a camera study can be “a great substitute for rapid empathy work.”</p>
        <p>However, he cautions that “getting buy-in from the participants to take photos of their lives is an essential, and not always easy piece.”</p>
        <p>Here are some quick tips from Bobby on recruiting willing participants</p>
        <ul class="list-no-style">
          <li>1. <strong>Build trust early:</strong> Ask for participation in person if possible.  It’s otherwise too easy for them to pretend they didn’t get the e-mail or text.  If you don’t know them, utilize someone who knows them well to communicate the need. </li>
          <li>2. <strong>Keep the assignment short, focused, and triggered by an emotion if possible:</strong> e.g. “Please capture a photo of your workspace just before or after lunch”, or   “Tomorrow, please capture a few photos of things at work that make you happy.”</li>
          <li>3. <strong>Clarify how photos will be used to address concerns:</strong>  e.g. “The sharing session will be a fun experience to help us understand things that are important to you.  Everyone will be bring in a few photos of their choosing (with sensitive material removed of course).  We’ll use these photos for the session only and you can share as few or as many photos as you like. You are in control.” </li>
          <li>4. <strong>Help participants see the value they are providing: </strong>Give an example of how a previous photo led to an insight that you wouldn’t have gleaned without seeing things first-hand.  e.g. “Photos were valuable in helping us understand in a previous project that some people treat their cubicle as more of a library than a work area…storing their stuff there, but not working there.”</li>
          <li>5. <strong>Help participants see the value they will receive:</strong> Remind them that this is all about improving the experience for them!</li>
