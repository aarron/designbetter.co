          <h3>The Ideal Wallet: Empathy</h3>
          <p>Got it? Ok, now let's see how effective your design is by talking to a few people.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Find someone nearby and interview them about their own wallet--a work colleague or a friend will do. You can even talk with someone over video chat, though in-person is better.</li>
            <li><strong>Spend at least 5 minutes</strong> learning about how they use their wallet.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="margin-top-xlarge">
          <p>Ask them to take it out and show you the contents. Your job is to design something meaningful for this person, so dig in and try to find out what is important for them. What are some of the emotionally charged objects they keep in their wallet—pictures of children or pets? Notes from a lover? What stands out as odd or interesting? Ask why a lot (and ask more than once; sometimes the <a href="https://open.buffer.com/5-whys-process/" target="_blank">technique of 5 why’s</a> can yield great insights).  Ask open ended questions and invite them to tell you stories about the things in their wallet.</p>
          <p>Great, well done. Now, <strong>set a timer for 5 minutes again</strong>, get out another piece of scratch paper, and try to come up with at least 5 solutions for the person you’ve interviewed. (They don’t necessarily need to be wallets, if you think you can <a href="/design-thinking/define">reframe</a> the problem in a way that leads to a more interesting solution. For example, a student in one bootcamp at Stanford designed a high heeled shoe with a money compartment for her partner, who likes to go dancing unencumbered by a handheld purse.) Be visual, and don’t worry about evaluating the idea for feasibility. The goal is to explore many ideas.</p>
          <p>Now place your two sheets of paper side by side, and compare the ideas. What do you notice? Were your ideas the second time around more interesting, or funny, or even innovative? Was it easier to generate ideas, and did they feel less contrived?  Do the second set of ideas feel like they are more specific, and tailored to meet the needs of the person you talked with? If so, you’ve experienced the power of empathy in action. With any luck you still got to see how designing a product with insights from user observation is a much more productive process than starting from scratch.</p>
