          <p>It’s always a good idea to have a warm up session to get your brainstorming group into the right headspace. This exercise is borrowed from <a href="http://www.creativeconfidence.com/" target="_blank">Creative Confidence</a>, and was developed by Bob McKim, one of the founders of the design program at Stanford.</p>
          <p>30 Circles may be done alone or with any sized group. Each participant will need a piece of paper with 30 blank circles on it (you can print <a href="http://www.theglobalday.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Worksheet-30-Circles-Bernstein-Maya.pdf" target="_blank">this template</a>, or ask participants to draw their own), and a pen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="margin-top-xxlarge margin-bottom-xlarge">
          <p>Here are the instructions: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Give each participant a printed <a href="http://www.theglobalday.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Worksheet-30-Circles-Bernstein-Maya.pdf" target="_blank">30 Circles template</a> and a pen.</li>
            <li>Set a timer for 3 minutes. Tell the participants to turn the blank circles into as many recognizable objects as possible before time runs out.</li>
            <li>Examine and discuss the results. </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="margin-top-xxlarge margin-bottom-xlarge">
          <p>In going over the results, did anyone fill all 30 circles? How many got 10 or 15? The quantity speaks to the <em>fluency</em> of ideas. How about the diversity, or <em>flexibility</em>, of ideas—are they all similar (e.g., faces), or divergent (a UFO, an eyeball, an apple)? Did anyone “break out of the circle” and connect several circles to form an object (an airplane, or a bulbous stick figure)?</p>
          <p>The great thing about this exercise is that it illustrates the difference between the fluency and flexibility of ideas; in a good brainstorm, you’ll want a balance of both.  It also show how we often assume that there are rules (stay in the circle!) even when they’re not given explicitly.</p>
