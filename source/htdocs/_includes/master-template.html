        <p class="wow fadeInUp">Tom felt lost. After four years of tremendous growth, his company was no longer the scrappy startup he&rsquo;d originally joined. In those early years, Tom simply rolled his chair over to a colleague&rsquo;s desk when he needed feedback on a design. The work was collaborative, feedback was immediate, his work was known and respected. It was fun! He was able to put on his headphones and devote all of his attention to design. </p>
        <p class="wow fadeInUp">Then things changed.</p>
        <p class="wow fadeInUp">The product and company grew&mdash;fast. He built out his team, and so did his colleagues. The company moved to a bigger office to accommodate all the new people, and before he know it a physical and mental distance developed between his design team and the rest of the company. The designs his team produced weren&rsquo;t always on people&rsquo;s radar, and subsequently stakeholders no longer understood the value of the team&rsquo;s work. </p>

    <p class="wow fadeInUp">However, storyboards have found their way into the product design process over the past few years. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanblec">Nate Blecharczyk</a>,co-founder and CTO at Airbnb, the act of creating a storyboard was a “galvanizing event for the company.” Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, was inspired by how Disney Studios made a huge leap from short animations to their first full-length film, <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em>, using storyboarding to shape the narrative.</p>
    <p class="wow fadeInUp">Airbnb’s quick initial success portended a large opportunity for growth, but Chesky struggled to see where they might best invest the company’s resources. Taking a cue from Disney, he worked with the design team to produce a storyboard showing the story of their two types of customers: guests and a hosts.</p>

      Stories are always better with well developed characters. User Personas and Job Stories can help you transform findings about customers into clear portraits of the people you’re designing for and their behavioral motivations.
