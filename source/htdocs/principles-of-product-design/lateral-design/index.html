      <p class="wow fadeInUp">To design better, we need to look beyond the confines of our craft. Design is more than color and form; <strong>design is the act of planning with the intention to serve others</strong>. Under this definition, the borders of design stretch beyond a single team.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Engineers, product managers, and researchers all have an important part to play in the design of a product. Their work, like ours, shapes the user experience. But despite shared interests, teams are often siloed by discipline, which makes collaboration and communication difficult, even dysfunctional. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><em>Organizational design influences product design</em>—significantly. If the relationship between the people who make a product is broken, the product will be broken too.</p>

      <h3 class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-none">Broken Teams, Broken Product</h3>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">Here’s a scenario that plays out in companies far too often: Katie and her team spent weeks perfecting the design of a new product. They presented the final concepts to stakeholders, got immediate sign off, then handed off their design files to Everett and his engineering team. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Though the dashboard design was stunning, Everett’s team had to gut it because the data Katie’s team wanted to display wasn’t actually available. They also had to throw out the account sign up design because the designers hadn’t included all the necessary fields. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">As Everett’s team continued to build the app, the distance between the intentions of designers and the execution of engineers widened. When Katie finally got a peek at the app, she was horrified and said, "This looks nothing like the design we created!"</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">She walked across the building to engineering and stormed into Everett’s office to demand an explanation. Everett, frustrated that he and his team weren’t consulted earlier, curtly explained the design concept was ignorant of engineering requirements. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The relationship between design and engineering was already rocky—this wasn’t the first time they’d felt out of sync. Now it had gone from bad to worse, and the product was a reflection of their animosity. It was a mess.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Like an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3jxWCJUPQQ" target="_blank">HBO’s Silicon Valley</a>, this story may hit a little too close to home. Katie and Everett are out of step, as their organization is operating with a handicap—they have a vertical relationship. Design, at the top of the process, passes work down to engineering to execute—engineers aren’t part of the problem solving phase. Subsequently, Katie’s team missed key technical details and key parts of the design had to be scrapped.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Vertical relationships also flow the other way—from engineering to design. Engineers rush to build a product’s infrastructure and pass it to designers for decoration afterwards. The results are equally disjointed, as buttons and type might look nice, but workflows built around database models instead of mental models leave users confused and frustrated.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Both scenarios are broken. Great products blend design and technology seamlessly. The <em>feel</em> and function of a product are interconnected, and equally important—like the right and left hemispheres of our brain that pass information laterally to synthesize creative thinking and logic. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">We can take a cue from nature. When we bring teams together to work laterally—working on the product at the same time in the same place—we can reduce process entropy and create better products.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">To make sustainable improvements to the way your organization designs products, you may need to take a red pen to your organizational chart. These sorts of changes don’t come easy or quickly.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">But before doing anything drastic, you can test the waters with some small experiments. Small projects with tight deadlines are a great place to start experimenting with cross-functional teams. If time is tight, start by investing just one week in a Design Sprint.</p>
      <h3 class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-none">Design Sprints</h3>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">A design sprint is a five-day process developed by Google Ventures for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Because it takes just one week, it’s a low risk way to try out a lateral design process in a cross-functional team.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The Google Ventures group goes into great detail in their <a href="http://www.thesprintbook.com/" target="_blank">Sprint book</a> and its related websites, but in short, over five days a small team will go from understanding the problem space to validating a design solution.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The Google Ventures group goes into great detail in their <a href="http://www.thesprintbook.com/" target="_blank">Sprint book.</a> If you survive the sprint and produce a great product idea, you’ll have set the stage for more cross-functional teamwork in the future.</p>
      <h3 class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-none">Working Groups</h3>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">Like design sprints, working groups assemble a cross-functional team to tackle a tough problem. But working groups stay together much longer than a week to produce a final product that’s actually shipped to customers. After the project is complete, everyone returns to their respective teams. </p>
      <p class="fadeInUp wow">Working groups have: </p>
      <ul class="wow fadeInUp">
        <li>Clearly defined objectives and metrics to measure success</li>
        <li>Designers, engineers, a product manager, and maybe even a design researcher</li>
        <li>The autonomy to make key decisions about the product they’re building</li>
        <li>A deadline to ship</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fadeInUp wow">MailChimp has a long history of assembling working groups to focus on hairy projects. One such team was created to design a new drag-and-drop email editor.</p>
      <p class="fadeInUp wow">A designer, a front-end developer, and two engineers—one of whom had a talent for prototyping—sequestered themselves behind closed door in a small MailChimp office to tackle the project. Sketching and debating, they looked at the problem from all angles.</p>
      <p class="fadeInUp wow">Sketches turned into simple prototypes. The designer explored UI concepts and made refinements. Developers coded out the new design, tweaking interactions as they went. Back and forth they worked, always sharing progress with one another immediately and inviting debate.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Though cross-functional teams offer a number of advantages, they can be challenging. Workgroups, because they’re temporary, rarely surface significant issues. Instead, designers might feel like they’re on a vacation—they get to learn new things before returning to the comforts of home.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Permanent cross-functional teams are more like expatriating—designers will wrestle with their  identity and struggle to adapt to a foreign land. Read on to learn how these problems, though common, are being solved at a lot of great companies. Going into an EPD structure with open eyes and a set of solutions will help you transition smoothly.</p>
      <h3 class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-none">Isolation</h3>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">As we saw in <a href="/principles-of-product-design/show-tell/" target="_blank">Show and Tell</a>, designers need regular feedback from other designers. In a cross-functional team, it’s common for a designer to operate alone, which leaves them craving conversations with peers. Organizations like Slack, Twitter, and the BBC offer some interesting solutions.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>Slack: Paired Design</strong></p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Lateral design in cross-functional teams is a mainstay at Slack, but designers always work in pairs, with one acting as the lead designer. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>Twitter: Design Reviews</strong></p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">In early 2014, Twitter transitioned from a centralized design team to embedding designers in cross-functional teams. In order to prevent designers from feeling isolated or unable to consistently learn from their colleagues, Mike Davidson, VP of Design, scheduled weekly <a href="/principles-of-product-design/show-tell/" target="_blank">design reviews</a> and other activities in the design studio to bring everyone together as a team.

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Designers who want to rotate within the UX&amp;D team speak to their manager to explore the idea. Approval is common if they’ve spent over a year on the same team.

  <div class="row align-center">
    <div class="medium-8 large-7 columns">
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Outnumbered as they often are in cross-functional teams, designers acquiesce to engineers who encourage smaller design iterations and a simpler approach. <em>Do we really need that animated transition? Does it add much value?</em> It’s difficult to champion the necessity of small details when you’re the lone designer. Many simply give in and get back to work.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">There’s nothing wrong with a little pushback between designers and engineers—it keeps both from becoming self-indulgent. But often, engineers push back on design simply because they don’t understand how to measure the success of a design.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Engineers measure success quantitatively:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How many lines of code were required?</li>
        <li>Did this impact site performance?</li>
        <li>How many bugs did we ship?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Designers measure success qualitatively:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does it look good?</li>
        <li>Is it easy to use?</li>
        <li>Is it delightful? </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Just as an engineer’s work shouldn’t be measured by design metrics, a designer’s work shouldn’t be measured by those of an engineer. Instead, designers and engineers, working together, must form a shared understanding of what constitutes success.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Recognizing this need, Spotify articulated a series of design values—principles that communicate what’s most important when solving a design problem—and made them available to the whole company. Common values help designers articulate their design decisions. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">For example, a large image occupying key space in a UI may seem indulgent to an engineer—<em>Is this photo really necessary? We could fit more data here if we get rid of it.</em> With the support of well defined design values in the vein of Spotify, a designer might respond, "Our design values state that a UI should ‘be alive’. This image creates movement, adds color, and brings an otherwise stagnate UI to life."</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">With a shared set of design values, priorities and how they’re communicated becomes clearer. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>Organizational design influences product design</strong>. Shared ownership, collaborative problem solving, and blended teams are key.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Here’s your to-do list as you put lateral design into practice in your company:</p>
      <ul class="wow fadeInUp">
        <li>Starting small with a 1-week design sprint</li>
        <li>When you’ve had a taste of the benefits of cross-functional teams, create a <strong>working</strong> group to tackle a project with a clear timeline and defined outcomes. You should have designers, developers, and a product manager on the team.</li>
        <li>When your organization is ready to go further, organize teams in an EPD structure. Engineering, product, and design should share power, and report directly to the CEO or COO.</li>
