      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Product roadmaps guide team milestones, but they only show us <em>what</em> to build and <em>when</em>. They don’t show us why we’re building a product. Stories, however, are great at explaining why. In <em>Start with Why</em>, author Simon Sinek proclaims that, "People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe." Similarly, the best product teams don’t merely <em>follow</em> a process; they march toward a shared destination—a vision of the future presented as a story that answers, "Why are we building this?"
      </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">We’ve been using stories to answer big questions for thousands of years. Long before humans could write, we used stories to share our most important messages. Through story, <a href="http://www.ancient-origins.net/human-origins-folklore/australian-aboriginals-creation-myth-00229" target="_blank">Aborigines passed down their origin through thousands of generations,</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux" target="_blank">ancient cave painters depicted the movements of the constellations and the magic of the spirit world</a>. Story is a tried and true methodology for collective understanding.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">We’ve been encoding information in stories for so long that our minds have evolved into story super-processors, easily plucking out important messages for long-term recall and helping us empathize with others. <a href="https://people.stanford.edu/jaaker/" target="_blank">Jennifer Aaker</a>, Professor of Marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, has found that "people remember information when it’s weaved into narratives up to 22 times more than facts alone." <cite class="number"><a href="#citation">1</a></cite> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/the-psychological-comforts-of-storytelling/381964/" target="_blanke">Findings from a study published in the journal Science</a> suggest that literary fiction "uniquely engages the psychological processes needed to gain access to characters’ subjective experiences." In other words, we can more keenly empathize with others when we learn about them through story.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Like thousands of stories told through the ages, product stories connect people and ideas. There are many ways to tell a product story, but they all start with a little bit of planning.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Product stories find their origins in research not genius. Customer interviews will expose important moments of frustration, aspiration, and triumph—all of which are potential plot points in your story. <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/improving-ux-with-pixars-storytelling-rules/" target="_blank">Pixar uses a simple narrative structure</a> to capture the essence of a story.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Unlike design comps and prototypes, product stories aren’t concerned with the UI of the product—just the people who will use it and in what context.

According to <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanblec" target="_blank">Nate Blecharczyk</a>, co-founder and CTO at Airbnb, the act of creating a storyboard was a "galvanizing event for the company." Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, was inspired by how Disney Studios made a huge leap from short animations to their first full-length film, <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em>, using storyboarding to shape the narrative.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Airbnb’s quick initial success portended a large opportunity for growth, but Chesky struggled to see where they might best invest the company’s resources. Taking a cue from Disney, he worked with the design team to produce a storyboard showing the story of their two types of customers: guests and a hosts.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">As Brian Chesky explains, "When you have to storyboard something, the more realistic it is, the more decisions you have to make."<cite class="number"><a href="#citation">4</a></cite> The act of drawing the frames of their storyboards forced the Airbnb team to consider the way their customers feel in each step of the process of renting or hosting.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Visualizing the experience puts you and your team there in the scene, building empathy with users as you strategize the design solutions. Airbnb’s storyboard helped everyone in their rapidly growing company rally around a common cause to design the products that will best serve their customers.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Though Airbnb’s storyboards are very high-fidelity, you don’t need to hire Pixar-quality illustrators to produce your company’s story.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>Quick tips for building your storyboard:</strong></p>
      <ul class="wow fadeInUp">
        <li>Post sticky notes in a grid on a conference room wall and sketch out each scene with Sharpies. Stick figures will suffice, but if you want to refine your drawing skills a bit check out <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/see-what-i-mean/" target="_blank">See What I Mean</a>, Kevin Cheng’s guide to drawing product stories. The act of thinking through the characters and the context of how your product will be used is the most important part of this process.</li>
        <li>Create photo storyboards using your phone. Get a few people together to act out the product experience, and snap photos of each step. Having a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HK8V4NC/ref=psdc_172646_t1_B004SGF82M" target="_blank">cheap wireless printer</a> on hand will make it easy to produce a high-fidelity storyboard in just a couple of hours. Drop your photos into Keynote or Powerpoint to create a quick presentation that can be shared in meetings or emails.</li>

      <h3 class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-none">Video</h3>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">When the stakes are high on a project and the timeline to completion is long, consider producing your product story as a video, which will help the people making a product connect with the customer experience. Video simulates real-life so well that it transports us to new places and make us feel like we’re part of the story. Video’s immersive qualities also make it good at forming long term memories—yet another important advantage when mobilizing large teams towards a common cause.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Video is also easy to share. Once you upload your video to a service like Vimeo, your product vision will have a URL that can be dropped in an email or a Slack channel for all to view and reference as needed.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">One disadvantage to producing video product stories is the required time commitment: you’ll need to write a script, gather some people to serve as your actors, and maybe rent some basic video equipment.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">While preparing for a major app redesign, the UX team I led at MailChimp produced <a href="https://vimeo.com/97337160" target="_blank">a vision video to guide the company</a> on what was to be a 4 month project. The research team had noticed after a number of customer visits that people were doing work differently. Persistent internet connections on phones and tablets let people work anywhere and all the time, ducking in and out of small tasks. This created a sense of found time that was quickly being filled up with more to-dos. As people became overwhelmed with their work, they needed to hand things off to others. Seeing these behavioral patterns, we realized we needed to rethink how MailChimp handled collaboration across many devices.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The project required the collaboration of many teams. We wrote a short script and worked with our in-house videographer to produce a brief vision video in about ten days.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">Job Stories come from the Jobs to Be Done framework developed by Clay Christensen, Harvard Business School professor and author of the influential book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244" target="_blank">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>. Core to Christensen’s Jobs to Be Done theory is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84LymEs67Y" target="_blank">we don’t buy products, we hire them to do a job</a>. By discerning the job a product is hired to do, we can better understand the motivations of customers.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Job Stories are based on customer interviews that employ <a href="">a very specific technique</a> that takes the customer back to the moment of purchase to expose the situations and motivations that lead to their decision.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Job Stories and User Personas are very different. Personas represent specific segments of customers that have a shared set of characteristics, skills, and perspectives. Job Stories are only concerned with a customer’s motivations within a specific context.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The storytelling mechanism you choose is less important than the story you tell. The act of creating a product story before you begin the design process not only helps you mobilize your teams, it also forces you to clarify your intentions for your product. You’ll step out of the maker’s mindset and consider how your product will fit into the lives of others.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp" id="citation">Peering through the microscope at the details and execution of a project is important, but only after we’ve gotten the perspective from the Earth to our North Star, getting a glimpse at the future we can create. Story First is a simple principle to help you and your whole company work together on big ideas.</p>
