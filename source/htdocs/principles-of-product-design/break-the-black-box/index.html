      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Tom felt lost. After four years of tremendous growth, his company was no longer the scrappy startup he&rsquo;d originally joined. In those early years, Tom simply rolled his chair over to a colleague&rsquo;s desk when he needed feedback on a design. The work was collaborative, feedback was immediate, his work was known and respected. It was fun! He was able to put on his headphones and devote all of his attention to design. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Then things changed.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The product and company grew&mdash;fast. He built out his team, and so did his colleagues. The company moved to a bigger office to accommodate all the new people, and before he know it a physical and mental distance developed between his design team and the rest of the company. The designs his team produced weren&rsquo;t always on people&rsquo;s radar, and subsequently stakeholders no longer understood the value of the team&rsquo;s work. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Sound familiar? This scenario is common in most growing companies. Design&mdash;once transparent, and integrated into the product process&mdash;becomes a black box, isolated from engineers and stakeholders, and in the precarious position of being misunderstood or ignored. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><strong class="text-purple"><a href="http://ctt.ec/800Cs" target="_blank" class="tweet">When design isn&rsquo;t visible, it&rsquo;s no longer powerful.<i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></strong></p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/inside-design-pocket/" target="_blank">At a small company</a>, it&rsquo;s easy to grasp the state of a project by asking a colleague for a peek at their designs. In large companies, spontaneous design conversations rarely happen; design is separated from executives and developers. Designs often remain guarded until a grand reveal brings stakeholders together. By that point, it&rsquo;s too late for honest feedback&mdash;the stakes and repercussions are that much higher because so much energy and emotion have already been invested in what&rsquo;s likely an off-the-mark design</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">This is a dangerous place for design&mdash;it sets the stage for spiked projects and designers searching for more fulfilling work. And of course, designers aren&rsquo;t the only ones who suffer. Companies that don&rsquo;t ship their best work run the risk of unrealized potential and less satisfied employees.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">As a company grows, everyone has to work harder—and smarter—at communicating. Designers who succeed in large organizations create social capital by developing a rapport with colleagues across the organization.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">You’ll have to get in the habit of stepping away from your computer to create the social capital  you need. Grab lunch with a developer who may build out your next design. No need for an agenda—just get to know each other. Spend time with researchers who have their finger on the pulse of your customers, sales people who hear frequent requests, product managers who understand schedules and scope, and customer service agents who know where users struggle the most. All have valuable context to offer you. Each one influences the success of your work.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">It&rsquo;s important to bring stakeholders into the design process early and often to get feedback and fresh perspectives. Sharing your work digitally makes it easy to gather feedback from specific people, but there&rsquo;s value in setting the stage for unsolicited feedback, too.
