      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The work of the modern designer lives in the abstract world of the computer, where every move we make is precise and effortless. Precision has its place, but not in the early stages of the creative process, when our ideas are still nebulous. There’s danger when creative exploration starts with perfection.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Perfection can create the illusion of certainty, something architect <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34tJ7JAjSW0" target="_blank">Frank Gehry</a> avoids as he begins a project. It’s discovery he craves. Craig Webb, Design Partner at <a href="http://www.foga.com/" target="_blank">Gehry Partners</a>, has heard Gehry say many times, "If I knew where I was going I wouldn’t go there." To Gehry, peak creativity lies in the unknown.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">His process begins with rough concepts. He and his team sketch, make models, then reflect. If the outcome isn’t right, they throw it out without remorse to begin again. Crude outputs early on make the work imprecious and completely malleable.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Though Gehry’s work is unique, his process is not. Many creative thinkers start wide and narrow down. Unfortunately, many software design teams take a different approach—they start narrow and refine too soon.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Steve Jobs once famously likened the computer to a <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/" target="_blank">bicycle for the human mind</a>. Computers help us make short work of complicated tasks and connect us to vast amounts of data—superpowers indeed, but when misapplied they can hinder the creative process.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Computers let us jump straight to pixels—a space of precision where everything aligns to a grid, vividly colored and fully formed. Precise outputs are precious and hard to abandon. This narrows creative exploration to just a few ideas well rendered.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">To find the best design solutions, we should follow Frank Gehry’s lead: crudely render many ideas to find the solution worthy of a more precise investigation.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The pencil is a humble tool that’s sparked millions of great ideas. It’s the inverse of a computer; it’s simple and limited in functionality, but its limitations make it so effective.</p>
      <p>Pencils are important to the creative process because:</p>
      <ol class="wow fadeInUp">
        <li><em>Pencils are inclusive. </em>They’re not just for designers—anyone can use a pencil to express their ideas clearly. The pencil is the great equalizer.</li>
        <li><em>Pencils are low-fi. </em>Quick sketches give no impression of a complete thought, signalling to all that it’s okay to offer feedback.</li>
        <li><em>Pencils aren’t fiddly. </em>Instead of getting lost in software settings or style, you’ll focus instead on your ideas.</li>
        <li><em>Pencils are fast. </em>You can explore vastly different solutions to the same problem in minutes, and you won’t feel bad throwing your sketches out because you invested so little time. </li>

Finally, frustration drives the client to snatch the pencil from his hand and draw it themselves. "Oh! I see!" Dennis responds.

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Sketching before we jump to the computer has many benefits, the greatest of which is that <a href="http://ctt.ec/800Cs" target="_blank" class="tweet">sketching keeps us laser-focused on ideas instead of the charms of design execution.<i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Design is often described as the act of solving problems for others. We cannot live up to that mandate if polish eclipses exploration in our creative process.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Putting pencils before pixels can help you bring others into the design process and win you allies. Gaining the broad perspectives of your colleagues early on will also help your team produce better design solutions.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Here’s your to-do list to put <em>pencils before pixels</em> into practice:</p>
      <ul class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-xlarge">
        <li>Generate dozens of ideas on paper before designing on the computer; sketching is a thought process that will help you discover the unexpected.</li>
        <li>Get engineers, product managers, and other key stakeholders to sketch with your team in the early phases of a project. This will clarify the project for all, and create a sense of shared ownership.</li>
        <li>If your team or clients are remote, use a USB cams to share sketches and ideate as a team.</li>
        <li>Constraints like fat markers or time limits on sketching can help you avoid getting lost in detail too soon.</li>
