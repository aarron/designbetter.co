      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Have you ever bought a lottery ticket? I admit, I’ve played a few times. You won’t be surprised to learn that I never did win the big jackpot. Seeing winners on the evening news gives the false impression that anyone could win, but the odds of winning are long—<em>very</em> long.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Rod Wolfe knows a thing or two about long odds. His friends call him <a href="http://time.com/3937179/lightning-strikes-man-twice-rod-wolfe-survivor/" target="_blank">"Lightning Rod"</a> because he’s been struck by lightning not once, but twice. What are the chances? Well, you’re more likely to be the next Rod Wolfe than you are the next lottery winner.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The software industry has a lot in common with the lottery. We see big winners in the news everyday—Facebook, Uber, Airbnb. Their success bolsters our ambitions of making the next big product. Our ambitions are big and we act fast hoping to beat competitors to the market.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Software success hinges on a Lottery-like collection of variables: the right product with the right features for the right audience in the right market. If you’re even a little bit off in your planning, you can end up wasting time and resources, and potentially putting your company in a very difficult situation.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">For instance, a couple of years ago the user research team at MailChimp stumbled upon an interesting piece of quantitative data: many customers connected their Facebook accounts to their MailChimp accounts. Based on the quantitative findings, the product team started to consider how to further the MailChimp-Facebook connection, but the qualitative findings from customer interviews told a different tale. Most customers only connected to Facebook because it seemed like something they <em>should</em> do given the social network’s popularity, <em>but they never actually did anything meaningful with the integration</em>. The product team changed course once the qualitative findings clarified the motivations behind the customer behavior. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>Why they’re useful: </strong>They can give you an aggregate view of customers’ thoughts on a particular topic, and they’ll help you find outliers who may make for good interviews.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Ad hoc surveys can be conducted in many ways. You can send <a href="https://24ways.org/2013/data-driven-design-with-an-annual-survey/" target="_blank">an annual survey</a> to collect customer data that can be used to inform a number of projects throughout the year. You could also send a survey to gather insights or guide development on a specific feature or new product.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">You needn’t survey <em>all</em> of your customers to get the results you need. Sending to too many people will produce lower response rates and introduce unwanted noise in your data. Instead, use your customer data to target the right people for your study before you send. For example, want to learn more about your customers who sell things online? Find a segment of those customers who have a shopping cart platform, like Shopify, integrated with your app. Want to hear from customers who are highly engaged with your product? Segment by ‘times logged in this month.’</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">But your time is limited and you probably can’t spend weeks talking to dozens of customers. How will you find the people who will give you the most insight? The answer lies in your survey responses!</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Your survey generated data from a variety of customers who can help you better understand how to design your product. Drop your survey response data into Excel and filter to find any of these types of customers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People nearby you can visit in person</li>
        <li>People who just signed up</li>
        <li>People who just closed their account</li>
        <li>People with interesting traits, behaviors, or off-the-wall responses</li>
        <li>People who’ve said they would or would not recommend your product to a friend</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">When you’ve found customers of interest, send them a short, personal email asking for a bit of their time to learn more about them. Interviews by Skype or Google Hangouts can be conducted in a conference room where your whole team can listen in—they’ll comprehend the feedback more easily if they can hear from the customer themselves. About 20-30 minutes is all that’s needed for a phone interview. It’s always a good idea to record interviews so you can reference them later.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Visiting customers in person takes a bit more time, but can be eye-opening. You’ll get to see the hardware they use, the distractions of their office, the flow of their day, and you’ll get to meet some of their colleagues. The entire experience will be a vivid reminder to you and your team that you’re designing products for real people.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><strong>Tips for conducting customer interviews:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customer interviews needn’t always be connected to a project. You can dedicate a day or two per month to talk to customers to keep your team in the habit of learning.</li>
        <li>Keep the number of people conducting the interview to a minimum so you don’t overwhelm your participant.</li>
        <li>Assign a person to take notes so the person asking questions is free to drive the conversation.</li>
        <li>Watch for signs of an energy change from the subject, raised voice, the use of profanity to punctuate a story, leaning in to emphasize a point—These indicate what’s important to your customer, and directs you to ideas for refinement or even new products.</li>
        <li>Bring a voice recorder to capture the interview so you don’t feel compelled to furiously capture every word.</li>
        <li>Each interview will yield one or two golden insights. Don’t get lost in the details—train your ears to listen for the meaningful insights.</li>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">While at MailChimp, my team noticed a small trend of customers departing us for more complex and way more expensive competitors. Using our surveys, we were able to recruit customers who had just recently closed an account and cited a competitor's platform as the reason. We set up 60-minute calls with a handful, and spent two days interviewing these former customers.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The survey pointed us in the right direction, but the interviews provided the missing link: these customers weren't leaving us because of our app's shortcomings; they were leaving because of a perception problem. Namely, they mistook the simplicity of the app for a lack of sophistication. These former customers were looking for a complex tool to make them feel like the accomplished professionals they are. It was eye-opening, and helped illuminate a new product direction for MailChimp.</p>

      <h3 class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-none">Existing Data</h3>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">Sometimes guessing less simply means becoming aware of the data you already have on hand. That’s exactly what happened at Bambora, a new global payments company based in Stockholm. Creative Director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andersfardigh/" target="_blank">Anders Färdigh</a> and his design team craved more insight to guide their work, but the thought of building a dedicated research team felt premature. Maybe there was a simpler starting point?</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><a href="/principles-of-product-design/break-the-black-box">During a meeting</a> with their COO, Patrik Göthlin, Anders discovered that much of the insight his team needed was already being gathered. Patrick’s operations team was doing extensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter" target="_blank">Net Promoter Score</a> research, surveying Bambora’s customers to determine their loyalty to the brand, and following up with detractors to learn where they were falling short. They’d even been visiting customers in person to capture feedback about their products. There was so much information already on hand to help the design and product teams prioritize their work.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">In large organizations it’s hard to know what research is already siloed within other teams. That’s why it’s important to spend time talking with colleagues on other teams to learn about their work and the research already underway. </p>

        <li><strong>Sales: </strong>These folks are talking with customers everyday all day. They’re collecting insights about product shortcomings and data about every potential customer. You may find that some of the data the sales team tracks in Salesforce could help you identify interesting customers to interview.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing: </strong>Analytics often falls to the marketing team to track. They can give you access to Google Analytics and other tools that may help you understand customer pathways and raise questions about interesting customer behaviors. Marketers are often at events talking with customers, and may have insights to share with you.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Service: </strong>Few teams have as much actionable information for refining your product as the customer service team. They hear the struggles of your customer daily and they know what themes are strongest. Make a habit of talking to many customer service agents to get the broadest perspective on your customers’ pain points.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Science: </strong>Your customer database is a goldmine of information. If you have a data science team then chances are they’re already querying that database to find customer cohorts. This team will be your most treasured ally as you dig deeper into customer research.</li>
        <li><strong>Engineering: </strong>Chances are you’re already working closely with the engineering team on the product, but you should also be talking to them about the data they could be logging for you. Curious about which integrations customers connect first to your app, or failure rates of a particular workflow? Your engineering colleagues can probably log that data for you and have the app email you a report. </li>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><a href="https://www.intercom.io/customer-feedback" target="_blank">Intercom’s customer feedback features</a> can help you get in touch with customers who have taken specific actions, so you can then ask them about their experience. Once you’ve defined the rules for the customers you want to speak with, you can create automated messages to be sent via email or in-app messaging. All of the feedback collected from your customers lands in a shared inbox where your team can tag and organize messages so you can identify patterns.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none"><strong>Builtwith</strong></p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">You can learn a lot about your customers just by examining the tools they use, and Builtwith will help you discover every technology your customers use to power their website. When a new customer signs up for your product, pass their URL over to the Builtwith API to retrieve and store their tech stack data for your research.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Why is that useful? Knowing that a customer is using Shopify, MailChimp, and Zendesk gives you clues about their business—they sell stuff online and have marketing and customer service teams; they’re using tools that are very design focused; and they’re using tools that are DIY, so they may not have developers on staff. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">As you look at the tech stacks of your customers you’ll begin to read them like tea leaves, giving you clues that can guide you to the right interviews and aggregate data to understand customer cohorts.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">You know why the lottery is fun despite being a losing game? There's not much at stake. I know the odds are wildly against me, but when I lose I'll only be out a few bucks. Rent will still get paid.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Product design also has tough odds, but the stakes are much higher. If your product fails to get traction with your customers, you and your colleagues could be out of a job. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><a href="http://ctt.ec/800Cs" target="_blank" class="tweet">"Fail fast" is the mantra of the software industry. The surest way to achieve that goal is by basing your product design on guesses.<i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Successful, design-driven companies are doing just the opposite—they're <em>succeeding</em> fast by guessing less. They're finding ways to inform their work each step of the way, tapping into existing data, setting up systems to continuously gather feedback, and they're talking to their customers all the time. Research isn’t some monolithic, academic process. It can fit into every workflow, every role, and every company size. Whether you’re a designer, project manager, or director, the goal is to guess less and work from a position of strength by being informed.</p>
