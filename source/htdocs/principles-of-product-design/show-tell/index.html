      <p class="wow fadeInUp">In some ways the school was like many others I’d visited—the energy of overly caffeinated students laboring over projects was palpable. But there was something peculiar about it: every space was messy. Not unkempt, but messy with ideas in progress. There was a sense of urgency to the way work was posted on walls and scribbled upon. Work tables were strewn with exacto knives, rulers, tape and scraps of paper—instruments of creation. All the furniture—desks, couches, work tables, and whiteboards—was fitted with casters and either pushed into clusters for conversation or lined up against the walls to open up room to build. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Make-Space-Stage-Creative-Collaboration/dp/1118143728/" target="_blank">The space was very carefully designed</a> to facilitate the chaos of creative thinking.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The energy was incredible, and I didn’t want to leave. The space had such strong affordances for experimentation and collaboration. It was an ecosystem of ideas, where projects sprouted and grew or died to make room for the next experiment. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The d.school’s design studio is so different from those in nearly every tech company, where the space is pristinely decorated and filled with desks for solitary work. The walls of most startups I’ve visited are reserved for clever posters or artsy murals, not the design concepts that will lead to the next product release. Those designs remain trapped in a legion of MacBooks, starved for critical discourse that could help them grow into something far greater.</p>

      <p>Building feedback into our design practice helps in so many ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It helps us avoid spending too much time on a design that may have significant flaws.</li>
        <li>It gives us multiple perspectives on a single problem, helping the designer get closer to an effective solution faster.</li>
        <li>Presenting work for feedback keeps the team synced on project progress, and holds everyone accountable to milestones and deadlines. </li>
        <li>As designers get in the habit of presenting their work and giving feedback to others, they learn to think more clearly about their design decisions, and become comfortable articulating their ideas.</li>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">It can be a little scary to give feedback—we don’t want to create conflict by coming across as negative. And receiving feedback is even more intimidating. No one wants their work to be criticized! With practice, your team will learn that these fears are misplaced.

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The more they talk about design, your team will develop the language they need to deliver constructive feedback, and their perspectives on the qualities of good design will mature. You’ll hear fewer vague observations and more constructive feedback that can improve <strong>the design</strong>. For instance, rather than hearing, “I like the type you’ve chosen,” you’ll begin to notice statements like, “The type selection feels trendy, which contradicts the project’s goal of inspiring trust in the content.” The former isn’t helpful, while the latter is instructive.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-xlarge">Tweaks in the language used in critiques can help ensure designers don’t take criticism too personally. Say “<strong>the design</strong> doesn’t meet the goals of the project,” not "<strong>you</strong> didn’t meet the goals of the project". Always talk about the work, not the person who made it.</p>

Online, are people commenting on work shared on Slack or InVision? Is your Trello board exploding with links to new ideas?</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Designing out in the open is just the first step. Your team will also need to get feedback on their designs, sync with teammates to make sure progress is being made, and learn from mistakes so they can do better next time. This is a tall order, and calls for different types of feedback processes.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Let’s take a look at a few ways to get your team the right feedback at the right time.</p>
      <h3 class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-none">Design Reviews</h3>
      <p class="margin-none"><strong>When they should happen:</strong> Early, midway, and at the end of a project</p>
      <p class="margin-none"><strong>Who should be there:</strong> The designer plus no more than 7 people</p>
      <p class="margin-none"><strong>How it helps:</strong> Designers get the feedback they need to refine their work</p>
      <p>Design reviews are critiques that let designers get detailed feedback that’s framed by the project goals. Design reviews can happen at a number of different points in a project. It’s often helpful to do one early on so the designer can get fresh perspectives before investing too much time in an idea that may be misguided. The midway point and towards the end of a project are also natural times to get additional inputs.</p>

        }
      %}
      {% include 'source/htdocs/_includes/image-small-caption.html' with vars %}

      <p>Never use a design review as a big project reveal. If you wait until you have everything polished, you’ll be too invested to accept the feedback you’re given.</p>
      <p>Design reviews are a great opportunity to bring in experts from other teams. Colleagues from product management, engineering, customer support, legal, marketing, or even an executive may have a new perspective to help you see the problem differently. But try not to overload the guest list in these reviews—too many people and you’ll have a hard time guiding the conversation.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  {% include 'source/htdocs/_includes/ellipses.html' %}

  <!-- Paragraph -->
  <div class="row align-center">
    <div class="medium-8 large-7 columns">
      <p>Design reviews are not a free-for-all. They should be run with these rules in mind:</p>
      <p><strong>Use a Facilitator</strong></p>
      <p>The designer is not the best person to facilitate a conversation about her work. She’ll have biases that could influence the feedback, and she needs to be free to listen to the conversation unencumbered. The facilitator will write down all of the feedback and share it with the design team after the review.</p>
      <p>A facilitator will set the ground rules for the conversation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>State the time limit for the design review.</li>
        <li>Introduce the designer and remind everyone that feedback should not turn into committee design. "Susan is the designer of the work we’re reviewing today. We’ll be helping her get fresh perspective on her work, but let’s offer feedback—not design suggestions. She will use our feedback to inform her decisions."</li>
        <li>Let people know how they should give feedback. "Feedback should be specific and candid. Let’s point out what’s working well and what needs refinement. Remember, we’re critiquing the work, not the designer."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don’t rush into the review. The facilitator should give everyone time to review the work and for their observations to take shape in silence before the conversation begins. </p>
      <p><strong>Frame the Problem</strong></p>
      <p>The facilitator should give the designer an opportunity to frame the problem at the beginning of the review, including any user and business goals. For example, "Users want to save money more effectively, and we want to keep customers engaged by teaching them to manage their money better." </p>
      <p>Identify the constraints of the project: "Due to legal constraints, we have to disclose this information before the user can enroll in this new program." If reviewers aren’t aware of the constraints and goals of the project, their feedback is unlikely to be helpful. </p>
      <p><strong>Say What You Need</strong></p>
      <p>The designer should state what she needs from the design review: "I’m trying to determine if this photo upload workflow is intuitive." This will help keep the feedback focused, and prevent the group from wandering into unproductive conversations.</p>

This helps to eliminate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect" target="_blank">bandwagon effect</a>, which happens when the views of the group conform to those of a few vocal people.</p>

      <p>Matt asks his team to rate their performance both as a group and as individuals on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest. Ratings tend to cluster in a similar spot, but occasionally there are outliers. Team members who’ve given starkly different ratings are asked to share their views in the meeting to promote transparency and honesty.</p>
      <p>Discussion in Treehouse’s retrospective meetings is centered around 3 questions common to most Agile retrospectives:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What worked well for us?</li>
        <li>What didn’t work well for us?</li>
        <li>What can we do to improve our process?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These questions are sometimes referred to as Start, Stop, Keep—what should we start doing, stop doing, and keep doing? </p>
      <p>Honest conversation about each of these questions becomes easier with the cultivation of trust and plenty of practice running retrospective meetings.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Before the Meeting:  </strong>Send an email asking the team to identify key points in the project timeline. This will be used to construct a master timeline of events, which will be discussed in the meeting. By focusing on events, you’ll avoid negative finger pointing,  which can derail the process.</li>
        <li><strong>Moderator:  </strong>Choose a moderator. This person, who wasn’t on the project and can be impartial, should be guiding the conversation from the whiteboard, taking notes for all to see.</li>
        <li><strong>Ground rules:  </strong>People recall events differently. The moderator can help the team agree upon what <em>actually</em> happened so lessons can be extracted. Establishing a timeline of events can help pinpoint where things went wrong.</li>
        <li><strong>Lessons and Actions:  </strong>As key lessons are identified, they should be written on the whiteboard for all to see. The actions required to mitigate the problems stemming from the failed project also need to be identified, assigned an owner, and provided a clear deadline.</li>
        <li><strong>After the meeting:  </strong>The lessons learned from the postmortem should be emailed to the entire team, along with the action items that are to be completed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Postmortems can seem rough, but they’re far superior to repeating the same mistakes. They’re a powerful opportunity for your team to learn and improve your processes.</p>

      <p>I’ve mentored a number of talented designers over the years seeking guidance on their career path. All tell me the same thing, "I just want to work somewhere where I can grow and learn." As they visit various companies, interviewing for their next design post, they can sense right away if the environment will give them the growth opportunity they crave. How? They recognize the signs of a company with a culture of feedback.</p>

      <p>They see work on the walls. They see the messy signs of creative progress. Design critique is fluid and not limited to formal meetings. These are the signs of a healthy design team, fueled by feedback and always improving.</p>
      <p>Building a culture of feedback takes time, but these simple steps will help you enact change:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rethink your design studio: </strong>Create areas for work to be posted to foster spontaneous design discussion. It’s okay to be messy. Scribble on comps, add notes notes, post different versions of the same concept. </li>
        <li><strong>Stay in sync: </strong>Schedule short, daily standup meetings for your team to sync up on projects. It may be best to schedule them at the end of the day, so you don’t block the mornings when minds are most creative and ready to design. </li>
        <li><strong>Make time for feedback: </strong>Schedule design reviews for every project. They should be frequent enough for designers to get the feedback they need to avoid going too far down the wrong path. </li>
        <li><strong>Learn and grow: </strong>Schedule retrospectives after every project to capture lessons learned. When things go wrong, a postmortem meeting will help you learn from your mistakes without pointing fingers. </li>
      </ul>
