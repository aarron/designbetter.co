Whether she’s in the kitchen, in the field, or at the market, she’s always tasting the food. Her palette guides her to the right flavors, aromas, and textures that can be combined to create an unforgettable meal. The alchemy of great cooking can only happen when the chef gets feedback at each step of her process.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">In the early 20th century, the boundaries of animation had been drawn and the industry was happily operating within them. The medium was crude—settings were flat, characters lacked personality, and the content was often limited to slapstick gags.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Then Walt Disney Studios changed everything.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Disney’s faith in the medium as an artform pushed the studio to experiment with new ideas that lead to astounding technical achievements. In 1928 they introduced sound with the release of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NQyzcDnMdE" target="_blank">Steamboat Willie</a>, and in 1932 they introduced full color with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTuIb7BIFqk" target="_blank">Flowers and Trees</a>. Each is an impressive achievement, but it was the studio’s contributions to process that enabled animation to evolve into the rich medium we know today.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">In 1931, seeking faster feedback on their drawings, Disney animators began making what they called "pencil tests:" rough drawings on inexpensive negative film that they fed into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moviola" target="_blank">Moviola</a>, a device with a small screen for viewing footage.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">This process let Disney animators meticulously refine their drawings immediately, not weeks or months later, and enabled them to learn the art of the medium faster than any other studio. Soon the animators began stringing together pencil tests to review entire scenes, the interaction of characters, and the delivery of the story.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">I used to create prototypes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a painful, time-consuming process that affected my judgement when testing.

They create <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhr71njlj7yv7r1/recruiting-screener.png" target="_blank">a form to screen customers</a> that asks a few carefully considered questions. A <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5kmofdms00sbh84/Google-Ventures-Research-Sprint-Screener-Worksheet.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">worksheet guides them to create a screener</a> that will target the right kinds of people.

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Be prepared to compensate your customers for their time—remember, they’re doing you a big favor by testing your prototype.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Alternatively, you could hire a professional recruiter to find customers for you. The downside is it can be very expensive, and it won’t be a hands off process. You’ll still need to give them enough information to target the right customers.</p>

        <li>Gregg invites the participant to an <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/introducing-invision-liveshare-real-time-design-meetings-in-your-browser/" target="_blank">InVision LiveShare</a>—a shared screen with voice chat where the customer can use the prototype while Gregg asks questions, observes, and takes notes.</li>
        <li>The session is recorded using <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/" target="_blank">ScreenFlow</a>.</li>
        <li>After the test session is complete, Gregg re-watches the video to fill in gaps in his notes. He then shares those notes and his insights with his Product team via Slack.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">This process is simple and fast, yet effective. It lets Vox’s remote product team get feedback from users anywhere without hopping on a plane.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">A service like <a href="http://lookback.io" target="_blank">Lookback.io</a> can also help you get fast feedback from both colleagues and customers remotely. <a href="https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205503919-User-Testing-and-the-InVision-Viewer-app" target="_blank">InVision and Lookback integrate to let you test a mobile app prototype</a> with customers. It records the customer’s screen, their interactions with your prototype, and even overlays a video of their face as they use your app, helping you read their emotional state.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">When your app is built, <a href="https://lookback.io/support/how-do-i-install-lookback-into-my-app" target="_blank">your developers can integrate Lookback into your app</a> so test sessions can be triggered any time. Users can shake their phone to reveal a secret button that triggers Lookback’s recording feature. All sessions are stored in a central dashboard for designers and developers to review and make revisions.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp"><a href="https://twitter.com/_lindseytron" target="_blank">Lindsey Campbell</a>, UX researcher at InVision, has a unique approach to getting customer feedback remotely. She’s set up a Slack channel to share prototypes with devout customers to get early feedback and bring customers into the design process. The design team monitors the feedback and tweaks the product as needed.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Like a chef sampling her ingredients, designers need to get a taste of the user’s experience while designing, not just after the product ships. When you shorten the feedback loop, you can learn faster how to make a product that will appeal to your audience. Here’s some guidance to get you started:</p>
      <ul class="wow fadeInUp">
        <li><strong>When should I build a prototype? </strong>After you’ve done <a href="/principles-of-product-design/guess-less">initial research</a> and <a href="/principles-of-product-design/pencils-before-pixels">worked through many ideas on paper</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>How much of the app should I build in my prototype?  </strong>Don’t waste time prototyping the entire app. Focus instead on the parts about which you have the most questions.</li>
        <li><strong>How real should my prototype be?  </strong>It should be real enough that customers won’t realize it’s just a prototype.</li>
        <li><strong>When should I show others my prototype? </strong>Early and often. Don’t let yourself get too far down a single path before you start getting feedback from colleagues. Show your prototype to customers after you and your colleagues have ironed out the kinks.</li>
        <li><strong>Who should I show it to? </strong>Start with the people in your design or product team. Be sure to get an engineer’s perspective to ensure the design you're proposing is technically feasible.</li>
        <li><strong>How should I present my prototype? </strong>It’s always best to show the prototype on the target device if possible. <a href="/seven-principles/show-tell"></a>Frame the problem you’re trying to solve before you ask for feedback from others</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fadeInUp wow">We’re fortunate to know the importance of testing, and to have access to tools that make capturing feedback cheap and easy. Whether remote or in person, your team can build fast feedback into your process so you can build better products faster.</p>
