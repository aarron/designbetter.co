      <h2 class="text-center wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-xxlarge">Why We Need Design Thinking</h2>
        <p class="wow fadeInUp">In 1958, four months after Sputnik launched and President Eisenhower created NASA, a Stanford engineering professor named John Arnold proposed that <a href="http://designprogram.stanford.edu/history.php" target="_blank"><em>design engineering should be human-centered.</em></a></p>
        <p class="wow fadeInUp">This was a strange thing for Arnold to introduce. After all, this was an era in which engineers were largely focused on twin Cold War driven goals: the space race and the optimization of the hydrogen bomb.</p>
        <p class="wow fadeInUp">Inspired by Arnold’s work, engineering professor Bob McKim, with the help of art professor Matt Kahn, created an engineering program called Product Design. Within this program, McKim and others helped create a design thinking process that became the foundation for Stanford’s d.school, as well as the guiding framework for design-driven companies like IDEO.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Why has design thinking been embraced not only by forward-thinking innovators like IDEO but large enterprises like IBM? For one, it brings everyone into the process, not just designers; using the design process helps companies solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem" target="_blank">wicked problems</a> with clear eyes.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Design thinking also helps scale the design process through large organizations.  Business leaders who use the shared vocabulary and toolset of design thinking can confidently create better, human-centered user experiences and disruptive products.</p>

However, Stanford’s d.school teaches a framework that can help jump-start the process for almost any problem:</p>
