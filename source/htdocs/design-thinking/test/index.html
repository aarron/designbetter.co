      <p class="wow fadeInUp">If you’ve ever been to a spin class, you may think there isn’t much variability in the experience: a dark room, music with a beat, an instructor yelling to change the level to an eight and keep pushing. Soulcycle offers something different. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">To test their early solutions and not be blinded by their assumptions, the Prolific team needed to tackle their challenge with fresh eyes. The Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki writes that "<em>In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few</em>." Adopting a beginner’s mind is valuable at every step of the design process. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">As you <a href="/design-thinking/empathize">Empathize</a>, it allows you to be open to the experiences of people from different backgrounds, and see things from their perspective. When you <a href="/design-thinking/define">Define</a>, it helps you reframe your point of view, to see a problem from a different angle. As you <a href="/design-thinking/ideate">Ideate</a>, a beginner’s mind prevents you from being judgmental about ideas that seem trivial or silly, but which may spur new approaches to a problem.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Building your <a href="/design-thinking/prototype">Prototype</a>, a beginner’s mindset helps to remind you that the purpose of a prototype is to answer critical questions quickly, not to highlight your mastery as a designer. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">And when you test your prototype, a beginner’s mindset opens you to both the many possible directions of your design and to the ways it might address real human needs. Each step along the way affords an opportunity to rethink, relearn, and reboot as needed—the design process is rarely linear.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">If <a href="/design-thinking/prototype">prototyping</a> is where the fun begins for many designers, testing is where it can get a little scary: getting your product ideas in front of real users for feedback can be daunting. But the whole basis for prototyping early and often is intended to keep us from forming attachments to ideas that may or may not be worthwhile. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">By testing our prototypes with real users in context, observing their reactions, and getting feedback, we can refine our <a href="#anchor">POV</a>, learn more about our users, and make the next iteration of the product that much better. As they say at Stanford’s d.school: "Prototype as if you know you’re right, but test as if you know you’re wrong." <cite class="number"><a href="#citation">4</a></cite></p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">It’s important to test prototypes early in the design process, so that you can quickly correct course if your product hypotheses are incorrect. As we discussed in <a href="/seven-principles/fast-feedback">Fast Feedback</a>, testing these assumptions early will help you build better products faster. </p>

Designed to act as a peer in digital learning environments, Tega’s facial expression recognition allows it to mimic a child’s demeanor, which the MIT team hoped would  help the robot and child bond during learning sessions. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">They could have tried to test this hypothesis in the lab, but they would have had no clue whether young kids would actually find the robot charming, scary, or boring.

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">These parameters are critical: they were testing the prototype in context (at a preschool, with kids in the target demographic), and were able to observe the reactions of the users in real-time. They didn’t rely on a survey or focus group about the experience (which with children at this age wouldn’t have worked anyway). Observing these gut reactions is what makes testing with a prototype so powerful; it’s hard for people to fake enthusiasm or hide frustrations when interacting with a product, and so the signal is clear. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">With these tests, the MIT team was able to determine that Tega was a promising platform for other educational contexts, such as helping students with learning disabilities. And they never would have discovered this if they hadn’t brought the prototype out into the real world, embracing the fact that they didn’t know what the results would be.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Having a beginner’s mindset, and testing assumptions early in the design process, will help you design better products faster.

    <div class="medium-8 large-7 columns">
      <h3 class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-none">Recruiting Users</h3>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">As we’ve seen in the examples above, running user tests in person is the ideal situation, but recruiting users to come to your office (or better yet, to visit in-situ where they will be using the product) isn’t always feasible. In the <a href="/seven-principles/fast-feedback"></a>Fast Feedback section of Design Principles, we run through some ideas for recruiting both in-person and remote users.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">Erika Hall’s <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research" target="_blank">Just Enough Research</a> also has some fantastic tips for recruiting users. She highlights the importance of setting the parameters for a good research participant (e.g., "shares the concerns and goals of your target users" and "can articulate their thoughts clearly"). She outlines how to create a screener, so that you can "weed out the axe murderers and the fatally inarticulate." And she gives some great tips on places to post a link to the screener: friends and family can be a great resource for sharing (assuming they are likely to reach your target demographic), and Craigslist (along with social media) is your friend.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">If you are constrained to remote testing, services like <a href="https://ethn.io/" target="_blank">ethn.io</a> and <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank">UserTesting</a> can provide you with users in fairly targeted demographics.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- h3  + p -->
  <div class="row align-center">
    <div class="medium-8 large-7 columns">
      <h3 class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-none">Testing the Prototype</h3>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">Once you’ve recruited your users, create an experience for them that puts the prototype into a context that is as close to real life use as possible, whether it’s before a workout like SoulCycle, or testing in a hotel like Savioke. You want your users to react to the <em>experience</em>, not to an explanation of the prototype. The more real-life it feels, the more natural these reactions will be. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">It’s also important to show, not tell. Once your user is set up with the experience, prototype in hand, don’t explain everything right away. Give them a chance to figure things out, and observe how they use the product: is it intuitive, or are your users confused or frustrated? What kind of questions do they have? Look for smiles or frowns as they work with the prototype.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Finally, remember in the <a href="/design-thinking/ideate">Ideate</a> phase where you came up with several ideas to test? It can be helpful to bring multiple prototypes to a testing session. This will give users more fodder to react to and compare against (e.g. "the version of the Soulcycle app that introduced the trainer with a video was great, but I really just need to book my session as quickly as possible, so I’m more inclined to use the version without it because it’s faster.")</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Capturing video and audio of your users in action with the prototype will be helpful in the next step. You don’t need anything fancy—just use the equipment you have at hand (smartphones and screen recording software will work just fine). Michael Margolis at Google Ventures outlines a <a href="https://library.gv.com/the-gv-research-sprint-interview-participants-and-summarize-findings-day-4-3d34792baa3f#.79dmmxamn" target="_blank">slightly more elaborate setup</a>, which can be handy if you’re testing mobile prototypes.</p>

      <h3 class="wow fadeInUp margin-bottom-none">Reviewing and Synthesizing Observations</h3>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp margin-none">After you are done with your testing sessions, it’s important to take the time to review and synthesize your findings. Again, <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research" target="_blank">Just Enough Research</a> is a great resource for this. In her section on analyzing the data from user research, Erika outlines how to structure the session (summarize goals, pull quotes and observations), the space and supplies that you’ll need (sticky notes and sharpies!), and the types of data to look for (like user goals and priorities).</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Another great resource for debriefing and synthesizing is from Brendan Mulligan at Cluster. <a href="https://library.launchkit.io/how-to-run-live-user-testing-part-3-the-debrief-d057dbe3a979#.sm6e6vfb3" target="_blank">Brendan outlines some great tips and techniques</a> for holding a viewing party and capturing insights from your team, and identifying and bucketing patterns as a group.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Once you’ve had a chance to synthesize the data and group patterns, take a look at how they support or contradict your original POVs. This is an iterative process; testing your prototypes should give you a chance to refine your original hypotheses and make the product that much better in the next round. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Compassion, in tandem with a beginner’s mind, helps us translate that empathy into action. If we instill a sense of duty towards our users in our designs, we can align our products with the humans who use them, and perhaps improve their lives along the way.

We hope that you have a chance to use these opportunities with empathy and compassion, and design products that <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/3-design-thinking-it-s-not-about-users-it-s-about-you-26229fbed013#.6em9b21j2" target="_blank">you are proud to bring into the world</a>.</p>
