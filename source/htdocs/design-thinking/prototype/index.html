      <p class="wow fadeInUp">One day in the early 1980’s, the computer scientist Danny Hillis was having lunch with the Nobel-prize winning physicist Richard Feynman.<cite class="number"><a href="#citation">1</a></cite> Hillis mentioned that he was going to create a startup, with the goal of building a parallel computer with a million processors. In typical Feynman fashion, the physicist responded that it was "positively the dopiest idea I ever heard." But he was intrigued, and by the end of lunch had agreed to spend the summer working at the company.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">During the first few months on the job, Feynman worked on the router circuits; these would allow the processors to communicate, and were far more complex than the processors themselves. The routers—tasked with ferrying information from point to point—had to find a free path through a 20-dimensional traffic jam between the processors, or hold the message in a buffer until the path was clear. A critical question was whether the design had allowed for enough buffering to operate efficiently.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Feynman began studying the circuit diagrams, and was willing to listen to explanations of why things worked. But he far preferred to use pencil and paper to simulate the action of each circuit and figure out everything for himself. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Feynman’s work on the routers helped the team discover the potential of the computer, which they had dubbed the Connection Machine, for complex numerical computing and physical simulation. This was useful for modeling things like the behavior of fluids and the simulation of artificial life, programs which other computers of that era were not designed to perform efficiently.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The team had initially assumed that their machine would not be capable of these types of number-crunching calculations, but Feynman argued that it was worth challenging this assumption.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">To settle the argument, and find out how well these computations would work in practice, Feynman had to create a prototype program to run. He was only really familiar with the programming language Basic, so he made up his own version of Basic that would run on the parallel processors. He would write the program, and then simulate it by hand to estimate how fast the Connection Machine could run it.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Feynman treated these challenges like a game, starting with very basic questions like "What is the simplest example?" He would then continue to ask questions until he had boiled the problem down into something he thought he could solve, which he would attack with pencil on paper. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Feynman’s contributions eventually helped the company become a leader in parallel computing, generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Although Richard Feynman was a physicist and not a product designer, he intuitively understood the power of prototyping. Prototyping helps us learn, solve disagreements, and test ideas quickly and cheaply. Feynman began the design process with <a href="/principles-of-product-design/pencils-before-pixels">sketches</a>, which helped him understand the problem and identify critical questions that the prototype needed to answer. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Building a prototype gave Feynman a chance to settle the argument he made for the capability of the Connection Machine to solve complex calculations. Without it, he and his colleagues might have sat in front of a chalkboard, endlessly throwing equations at each other and citing research papers.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Finally, instead of taking the time to teach himself a more complex language, he used familiar tools to quickly build a program which simulated the efficiency of the machine. If he had failed at this point, it only would have cost days or weeks instead of months. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Framed in this way, it is clear why design-driven companies prototype early and often, throughout the design process, to create better products. In the remainder of this article, we’ll look at a case study where Uber prototyped to help them build better products for multilingual use, and we’ll run through some techniques which can help you and your team instill a bias towards prototyping from the beginning of the product design process.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Uber, the increasingly ubiquitous ride-sharing service, boasts some impressive statistics. As of the writing of this article, over 1 million Uber drivers (or “driver partners,” as Uber prefers to call them) had given over 2 billion rides to over 8 million users. And no matter what major city you travel to internationally, you are likely to find an Uber driver: they have a presence in over 400 cities in 70 countries.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Designing Uber’s app to work seamlessly for the drivers and riders in this multitude of countries offers a unique set of challenges. There are differences in languages, of course, as well as with symbology and wireless access speeds. All of these variables had to be taken into account as Uber worked on a ground-up redesign of its driver app in 2015. <cite class="number"><a href="#citation">2</a></cite></p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The team began with lightweight prototypes of the app, using Sketch and InVision, in English. As they worked through these flows, they had to also take into account their global audience, so they would go back into the Sketch files and update the languages so that they could create, for example,  Hindi or Chinese versions of the InVision prototypes.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">With these prototypes in hand, the team could <a href="/design-thinking/test">test</a> with users in each country, and begin to answer critical questions about where the app might either be confusing or fall short of an excellent user experience for the drivers. They began with the navigational structure: what were the important functions to drivers, and how should they organize the content of the app? When they moved to the evaluation phase, they asked whether terms like “Earnings” and “Ratings” would translate appropriately into the other languages.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Along the way, they made some interesting discoveries. For example, one of the icons for Earnings was a bar chart, which represented what the Earnings screen looked like when you tapped into it. However, when they tested the prototype in India, drivers thought the icon would take them to their network settings. High latency and slow speeds  kept the network at top of mind for Indian drivers, and the Earnings icon closely resembled a signal-strength icon you might see in the status bar of a smartphone. </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">This discovery allowed Uber designers to alter course and create an icon more representative of cash, which solved the problem before it had a chance to crop up in a live product. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">In these initial builds, there was no feedback to the driver after tapping the button to go online—just a delay while the app called to the server to verify that the driver could accept trips in their current area.  To the driver, the app appeared frozen. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">In this case, adding an animated transition, which normally might be considered non-critical “polish” of the app, was critical to its function. The animation resolved this problem and improved the user experience for the drivers.  </p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">One important thing that the Uber team did throughout the design process was to match the fidelity of their prototypes to the questions that they had to answer; early in the process, low-fidelity prototypes to get a better handle on how the product translated into other languages. As the product direction solidified, higher-resolution, functional prototypes to iron out some of the potential user experience roadblocks.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">As a designer, you’ve almost certainly built prototypes of a product before releasing it, but you may be looking for ways to insert prototyping earlier in your process. When considering the fidelity of a prototype, it’s always important to consider the kinds of questions that you are trying to answer, and to be cautious about interpreting the results of testing very low-fidelity prototypes with users (see Daniel Burka’s sidebar about prototype fidelity).</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">That said, if you are working out the flow of a new feature, or trying to communicate ideas to team members, sketches and paper prototypes are completely valid ways of moving forward. Here we’ll outline a number of techniques and ideas for moving prototypes to the beginning of your design process. A number of these can also be found in the Stanford d.school <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/use-our-methods/the-bootcamp-bootleg/" target="_blank">Bootcamp Bootleg</a>.</p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Challenge yourself to work quickly; set aside an hour and create 2-3 variations of the prototype. Screens can be sketched by hand, captured on a smartphone, and brought into InVision to be made interactive.

      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The music-streaming service Pandora has an almost magical ability to create playlists of the songs you like, just by choosing a song or artist, and rating a track or two with a thumbs up or down. The company likes to give credit to its Music Genome Project, which attempts to categorize all music by its attributes (tempo, vocals, etc) and then sort them using a complex algorithm.</p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Early on, however, the company realized it needed a human touch to make the playlists resonate with human ears. Much like the Wizard of Oz, there is a human behind the curtain who is categorizing and describing each song as part of the “algorithm.” <cite class="number"><a href="#citation">3</a></cite></p>
      <p class="wow fadeInUp">You can take advantage of this technique, too. If you’re building a chat-bot, for example, have a human on the other end supplying the replies until you better understand the needs of the user. Or if you are trying to build an on-demand service (let’s say Uber for dog walkers), you and your team walk the dogs yourselves before you build out the infrastructure to summon actual dog walkers on demand. Tools like <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a> can be using for connecting the services needed to build prototypes like this—pushing a button can simply send a text right to your product team.</p>
